Lesson 2: Activities and intents

2.3: Implicit intents

In this section you create a new app with one Activity and three options for actions: open a web site, open a location on a map, and share a snippet of text. All of the text fields are editable (EditText), but contain default values.


12. Homework

Add another button at the bottom of the screen.

When the Button is clicked, launch a camera app to take a picture. (You don't need to return the picture to the original app.)

Note:

If you use the Android emulator to test the camera, open the emulator configuration in the Android AVD manager, choose Advanced Settings, and then choose Emulated for both front and back cameras. Restart your emulator if necessary.
